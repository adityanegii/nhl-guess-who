There are two games on the website. 

The first game, "NHL Guess Who," challenges players to use their knowledge of NHL players to guess the identity of a specific player. Players are provided with a series of clues and information about the player, such as their team, position, nationality, and career highlights. With each guess, players receive feedback on which aspects of their guess are correct and which are incorrect. This game encourages players to think strategically, make educated guesses, and learn more about the diverse pool of NHL players.

The second game, "Team-Hopper," tests players' knowledge of player transfers within the NHL. Players are presented with a list of teams that a particular player has played for, and they must identify the player based on this information. After each guess, the game reveals the next team associated with the player, allowing players to narrow down their choices and progress through the game. This game challenges players to recall player histories, team affiliations, and transfer details, enhancing their understanding of the dynamic nature of the NHL.

Both games leverage the power of the NHL API to provide accurate and up-to-date information, ensuring a seamless and immersive gaming experience. Through these games, I aimed to combine entertainment with education, fostering a deeper appreciation for NHL players and their career journeys.

##

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
